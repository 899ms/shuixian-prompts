## What is this

A **Chinese prompt library for AI art**: prompts collected from all over the place, each paired with its generated result, so you can find them, understand them and copy them straight into your tool.

The prompts cover Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Flux, ChatGPT and Gemini, plus Chinese models such as Jimeng (即梦), Kling (可灵), Doubao (豆包), Hailuo (海螺) and Wenxin Yige (文心一格). The site is **pure static pages**; code and data are fully open source, while the images live in Cloudflare R2 — the repository only holds code and JSON.

**Live site: <https://prompt.qqsrc.com/>**

## ✨ Features

**Find**

- Keyword search: fuzzy matching (`海报设计` also hits 「设计感海报」), with highlight in results
- Pinyin initials: type `sbpk` to get 赛博朋克 (cyberpunk)
- Facet tags: medium (12) / style (16) / tone (8), with live counts and multi-select
- Filters: only-with-image / with-note / favourites / used
- Command palette: `Ctrl / ⌘ + K` searches commands, categories and prompts in one box

**Use**

- One-click copy; prompts with parameters open a form and copy a **ready-to-use** result instead of a template
- Image download (filename auto-built from title + ID), `#id=` deep links, context-aware ‹ › paging in the lightbox
- Notes and a “used” counter — saved as you type, kept in your browser only

**Manage**

- Collections: multiple collections, drag-and-drop ordering, move between collections
- Export to Markdown / JSON / CSV (BOM included so Excel opens it cleanly), and re-import your own JSON

**More**

- Two skins: modern (page-per-view) and classic (12-category card wall) — one button in the header switches
- Full bilingual UI: click `EN / 中` to translate the whole site, including all 87 category names; the choice is remembered
- PWA: installable to desktop, browse the shell and lightweight data offline; press `?` for shortcuts
- Userscript: summon a sidebar to search and copy from ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini / Midjourney / 即梦 pages

## 🚀 Run locally & deploy

Serve it over HTTP — opening the HTML directly will hit `fetch` CORS limits:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaYue-SYJ/shuixian-prompts.git
cd shuixian-prompts
python -m http.server 8094 --directory shuixian-unified
```

Open <http://localhost:8094/> and use the button in the header to switch between the modern and classic skins.

**Deploy**: `shuixian-unified/` is a self-contained static folder — drag it into Cloudflare Pages or any static host.
Caching rules live in `_headers`; after changing CSS / JS bump the `?v=` and `ASSET_VERSION` (4 places in total), then purge the cache.

## 🎨 Two skins

Same dataset, two ways to browse. The switch tries to stay on the same kind of page (home↔home, gallery↔gallery, favourites↔favourites).

| Modern — one page per view | Classic — 12-category card wall |

## 🗂 Data

Loaded in layers: a lightweight list renders the first screen, the full data is fetched only when you open a detail view or copy a prompt.

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `data/list.part1~3.json` | Lightweight list (title, category, likes, image path) — first screen |
| `data/prompts.part1~3.json` | Full data including the `prompt` body — loaded on demand |
| `data/meta.json` `data/categories.json` | Category structure (major → subcategory tree / flat map) |
| `data/pinyin.json` | Hanzi → pinyin-initial table used by pinyin search |

Fields: modern skin `id` `title` `prompt` `image` `category` `likes`; classic skin adds `themes` `styles` `person`.

Images are not distributed with the repository: originals live in Cloudflare R2 and the site loads them from
`https://r2.qqsrc.com`. The base URL is the `IMG_BASE` constant in `js/base.js`.
